<!-- Title: Fighters110

Description of Project: 
This project is a King of Fighters-style game where two fighters battle each other until one of their health levels reaches 0. In this game,
there are two characters: Kris and Bob Ross Kris. Each character can shoot out a projectile to damage the other, with the controls E and PgUp,
respectively. As the characters overlap, one character loses health, based on a random number generator.

110 Programming Concepts Used (what, how, and why?):
a. Functions - Functions were used to manipulate certain variables in groups that needed to be changed throughout the game. For instance, the changeHealth
function took in parameters for both sprites to manupulate both of their health levels. This helped to simplify the game's code and reduce repetitiveness.
b. If-then-else statements - If-then-else statements were an important part of this game, because it allowed the implementation of movement based on
boolean values and the changing of health levels. It also helped create the winner! pop-up text once a character's health reached 0.
c. For loops and arrays - Were used to move projectile sprites and to update health based on the arrays of projectiles. For loops were the most 
efficient method, since it goes through arrays until the end of the array to manipulate the variable at each index.
d. Scoping and variable declaration - Variables had to be declared in the correct section to ensure it can be accessed inside of different functions to be 
changed as needed by the game.

Challenges Overcome / New Concepts Learned:
- Making the two characters move simultaneously: I learned that the key down function and key up function could be used to make both characters move by
  changing boolean values. The key down and key up work together to change the movement variable to true, then false on key up. This allows for continuous 
  movement by both characters.
- Creation of moving projectiles: I learned how to apply the idea of scoping with the new concept of a ticker in the game. This helped me realize
  I should initialize new sprites as projectiles outside of the ticker, while manipulating those initialized sprites inside of the ticker.
- Adding sound was a challenge that I overcame by googling to find someone who had a similar issue and a solution. I learned about importing into the file.
- Making projectiles move in direction faced: I struggled with this because my first method of implementing it made existing projectiles change directions
  mid-air with the characters. However, with some to reason through the issue, I found a simple solution by separating projectiles into two separate arrays
  per character, based on direction faced when the projectile was created.

(If group work) Individual Contributions to the Project: N/A 

Goals Achieved:
- Creation of two fighter sprites
- Adding smooth, vertical movement
- Adding projectiles from each character which shoot in the direction the character faces
- Health bars decrease on hit
- Initial instructions during game start that disappears
- Sound: Background music and effects for shooting projectiles

Goals Outstanding / Future Work:
- Creation of a character selection screen with more characters
- Adding a continue option for the game
- Adding a timer to count down, limiting fighting timer
- Character animation based on fighting moves
- Character and background interaction
- Possible team-mode where a team can be formed and characters exchanged -->
